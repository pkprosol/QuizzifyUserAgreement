##Welcome to Quizzify!

Thanks for using our product (“product” or “products")! Quizzify is provided by Quizzify, LLC (“Quizzify” or “the company") headquartered at 39 E 30th St, New York, NY 10016, United States.

By using our product you agree to the following terms.

##Using Quizzify

You may use Quizzify through our official apps. Do not attempt to access our product through any means other than our regular iOS or web apps as provided to you by the company directly. Do not interfere with or attempt to change the behavior of our products in any way [that is not part of the normal interface we provide]. We may suspend or block users who we deem to be misusing our products in any way.

Quizzify owns all intellectual property related to or contained in our product, including but not limited to our content, our interface, our logos and marketing language, our methods and interfaces for interacting with users. You may not use any of our content or technology for any other purpose than using our apps yourself without written permission ahead of time. Do not remove or copy any content, notices, or terms from any of our products.

We present information gathered and communicated based on the research and judgment of our team. Quizzify does not practice medicine and none of the information we provide is personalized medical advice that replaces or overrules any advice you may get from a doctor or other healthcare professional. We provide you information for educational purposes but any actual medical decisions should be made only in consultation with appropriate licensed professionals. By agreeing to use Quizzify, you waive any liability of Quizzify in terms of any and all harms, outcomes or behaviors that may result from the information contained herein. Quizzify seeks to present accurate information to customers on all the subjects we cover, but because scientific and medical information can be imperfect or can change, we are not responsible for any errors in presentation, content or interpretation that may occur. Quizzify may from time to time update its content based on new findings, a better understanding of given content, or feedback from our users at our own discretion.

You agree to receive various notices or communications as a condition of your use of Quizzify. Some of these may include the possibility of opting out of further communications of a certain type.

##Your Account and Privacy

Quizzify may ask you to create an account and/or provide certain information about yourself to enhance your experience. Please keep any passwords or other private information confidential and secure. Quizzify collects some data on yourself and your usage of our apps for the sake of improving your and other users’ experiences. We will not voluntarily share any of this information with any third parties except with your explicit permission (e.g., if you’d like to redeem money from your employer we may offer you a means to do so). We will own any data you provide us in terms of questions you answer, your behavior in the app and all other information you may provide. However, we only intend to use it to continue improving the quality of our product, not for any third party marketing. If we provide any data to your employer or another third party, it would only be in aggregate and you would not be identified by name (unless you explicitly agree to do so). Quizzify aims to keep your information secure. However, please recognize that digital security is a growing issue in the industry and there is always the possibility, in theory, of some third party hacking into our data sources. This is another great reason to use unique, difficult to guess passwords in all your digital services. By using Quizzify you recognize and consent to all of these privacy and other terms in this agreement.

##Modifying These Terms

We may change these terms and conditions at any time. For the latest please visit this site. Your usage at each point in time constitutes ongoing consent to the current version of the terms and conditions at that point in time.

We may also terminate our services at any time, with warning at our discretion.

##Disclaimers

Quizzify does not make any specific promises about our products, including their content, quality, or security. You agree to use the product as is and assume any liability resulting from its use. The product may not meet your needs or your expectations.

##Liability

Quizzify does not assume any liability of any kind related to your use of our products except as otherwise stated in any agreements. To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Quizzify to a given user or organization will never exceed the amount paid by said user or organization, unless otherwise agreed by written contract.

##Business Usage

Any business using our product agrees, as a business and for each individual user, to abide by these terms and to forgo any claims of liability regarding Quizzify.

##About These Terms

If any term here turns out to be unenforceable, that will not affect any other terms or the overall agreement. If these terms conflict with any contract or additional agreement, the latter will overrule the relevant terms herein that conflict without impacting other terms that do not conflict.
